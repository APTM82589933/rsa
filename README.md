# rsa
I haven't looked at this for mannnny months but I plan to make it as well described and perfectly concise that every computer enthusiast would find it useful to tatoo this somewhere on their body and use RSA n-bits in the most efficient way possible manually or with the help of various machines

Then Tufts University may offer courtesy MSCS admissions if I sign it pre-Tufts project

Anyways I remember how to determine if-prime very quickly at 2048 or n bits then for python i'm not sure if huge 2048 bits could do the operations python supports so this starter code may or may not have bugs can't remember
